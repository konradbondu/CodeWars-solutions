# Complete the function scramble(str1, str2) that returns true if a portion of str1 characters can be rearranged to match str2, otherwise returns false.
#
# Notes:
#
# Only lower case letters will be used (a-z). No punctuation or digits will be included.
# Performance needs to be considered
# Input strings s1 and s2 are null terminated.
# Examples
# scramble('rkqodlw', 'world') ==> True
# scramble('cedewaraaossoqqyt', 'codewars') ==> True
# scramble('katas', 'steak') ==> False

    # Counter basically creates a dictionary of counts and letters
    # Using set subtraction, we know that if anything is left over,
    # something exists in s2 that doesn't exist in s1
    return len(Counter(s2) - Counter(s1)) == 0
